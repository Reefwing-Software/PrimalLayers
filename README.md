# Primal Layers

The Primal Layer model offers a biologically inspired framework for building intelligent systems from the ground up, mirroring the layered evolution of the brain. 

At its core is the Foundational Layer, responsible for maintaining basic operational stability, akin to the brainstem's role in regulating heartbeat, respiration, and homeostasis. Above this sits the Motivational Layer, drawing parallels to the limbic system, which introduces drives, emotions, and prioritization of behaviors. The Control Layer governs motor planning and coordination, much like the cerebellum and spinal circuits that manage complex yet unconscious movement patterns. Finally, the Cognitive Layer reflects neocortical functions, enabling abstract reasoning, symbolic processing, and conscious decision-making. 

By organizing intelligence in this layered manner, the Primal Layer model hard wires in robustness, adaptability, and safety.
